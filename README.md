**Price Comparison Tool Problem**

This will be a multi-part question and the expectation is you likely won’t complete it in the 2-hour time allotment. 

Build a price comparison tool that will get pricing and availability data from these sources:

**URL 1**
  https://appedia.heb-platform-interview.hebdigital-prd.com/api/v1/itemdata?upc=101 Response
  {
  "price": "$4.77",
  "stock": 7
  } Description
  Price is returned as a string
  Availability(‘stock’) returned as an integer value, 0 meaning out of stock.

**URL 2**
  https://micromazon.heb-platform-interview.hebdigital-prd.com/101/productinfo Response
  {
  "available": true,
  "price": 5.67
  } Description Price is returned as a double Availability(‘available’) returned as a boolean value

**URL 3**
  https://googdit.heb-platform-interview.hebdigital-prd.com/101 Response
  {
  "a": [
  {
  "l": 8839,
  "q": 4
  },
  {
  "l": 1292,
  "q": 0
  }
  ],
  "p": 478000000
  } Description Price is returned as microcents (ie 234000000 == $2.34) Availability(‘a’) is returned as an array of objects with quantity(‘q’) available at location(‘l’)

**Requirements**
  • Return the URL that has the lowest price and has the item in stock at any location.
  • Make it easy to swap item UPC. 
  • Make it easy to add additional merchant URLs to query for price comparison. 
  • Write unit/integration tests.
