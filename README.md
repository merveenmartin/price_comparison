# Technical Problem Review

Hi "Candidates Name Here",

Thank you for your interest in the "Team here" team.  The first part of your Engineering interview includes producing some sample code for you to review with the interviewer during the Technical Problem Review interview. Please see the “Technical Problem Review” pdf in this repository for instructions of step 1 of the interview process.


Prior to starting your project, we will schedule a 15-minute Q&A session via Zoom with the interviewer so that you have the opportunity to get clarification on the problems outlined and ask any questions you may have. After your 15-minute Q&A, you will begin working on the project over the next few days. A few days after your Q&A, we will schedule you for a one-hour Problem Review over zoom. 

 
As a reminder, we do not expect for you to spend more than 2 hours of your own time on this exercise. 

 
Please let us know your availability for both the 15 min Q&A session as well as the one hour project review/tech screen.

 
Please let us know if you have any questions in the meantime.  We look forward to seeing your work!
